I am a master student in Department of Automation at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My research interests lie in **Neural 3D Reconstruction(both novel view synthesis and 3d reconstruction)**, **semi-supervised learning** for data-efficient computer vision. I am very passionate about both research and engineering and willing to collaborate with others.
